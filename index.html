					Thank you for participating in our study. We are conducting a study for a course in
					research methods in human-computer interaction, and seek to understand how
					different structures and sorting of comments on websites affect the reader's
					perception of the discussion. 
					
					<br />
					<br />
					
					We will show you a selected section of comments* related to current events, and
					then ask you to rate how you perceive the interaction among the users. 
					
					<br />
